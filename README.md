# Benk-Media-Server
Media server webapp for my roommates and I. Yeah I could use something that already exists but I want the practice, brah.

Goals:

Play media on the server (It already does this, but I would like to make a better player, at least for music;
                           currently, it only uses the default audio/video player included in the browser)
                           
Allow users to add new directories and files via upload (DONE)

Allow users to delete dirs and files

Add styling to make it not look like shit

Automatically grab media from online sources

Possibly create a Desktop app to go with it? (Probs not)
